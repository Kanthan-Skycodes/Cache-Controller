# Cache Controller
Built a L1 cache (direct mapped) and L2 cache (4 way set associative) hierarchy with integrated main memory. Designed the cache controller to manage hits, misses, and write-back policies, ensuring efficient read/write operations and minimal memory access latency.
Utilized a Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm for cache eviction and to optimize cache performance.
